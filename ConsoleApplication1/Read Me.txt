> Register App -> you will get 1. Client ID 2. Client Secret
> That app will also have a name registed on the PLATFORM you are working on.
> First of all make a Link, that user will goto in browser that will take user
  to PLATFORM's website and present it that usermade app's name and permissions
  that it seek and do you want to allow it to access or not? 
> If yes then it takes it to the "Redirect Uri" that you have registered while
  creating the App on the PLATFORM.
> That Redirect Uri link will take you that redirect uri link plus some added
  query strings to it. One of the query string variable will be "code" 
  [that was used by both reddit and twitch but in case of twitch the 'code'
   didnt work but second method in which one of query string variable was 
   'token' worked. Plus Twitch apps's token or code are for ever, they dont
   need to be refreshed nor they are either temporary or permanent, whose both 
   lifetime is 1 hour, but permanent can be refreshed, as this all was present in
   reddit OAuth implementation.]
> Use that 'code' value in the next call to PLATFORM API with 'code' value in 
  the 'headers' of that call. This will eventally return you a 'token' hopefully
  for an hour, but permanent for twitch.
